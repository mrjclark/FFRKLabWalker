This is a script to automatically walk through the labyrinth in Final Fantasy Record Keeper. It uses the pyautogui module with OpenCV to recognize images on screen. The order of the clicks is the scripted. 

This is not a fast script. Due to the speed of the development machine, lots of sleep timers were inserted to ensure that screens came up as expected. 

This is not a plug and play script. All images in the ./Images/ folder need to be retaken on the machine running the script. 

One big assumption is that there is an all powerful team in slot 1 of your lab party setup.
