This is a script to automatically walk through the labyrinth in Final Fantasy Record Keeper. It uses the pyautogui module with OpenCV to recognize images on screen. The order of the clicks is the scripted. 

This is not a fast script. Due to the speed of the development machine, lots of sleep timers were inserted to ensure that screens came up as expected.

Feel free to use this as you wish. Just don't sell it.
